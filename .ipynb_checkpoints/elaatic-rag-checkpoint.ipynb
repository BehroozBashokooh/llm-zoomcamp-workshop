       "'The error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" typically occurs when you\\'re working with Docker on Windows and the repository name includes uppercase letters or spaces. Mapping volumes on Windows can be particularly tricky. Here are a few solutions you could try:\\n\\n1. **Move Your Data Directory**: Ensure that your data is in a directory path without spaces. For example, if your code is in `C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/...`, move it to something like `C:/git/...`.\\n\\n2. **Replace the `-v` Part**: Try different volume mapping options:\\n    - `-v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n    - `-v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n    - `-v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n    - `-v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n    - `--volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n\\n3. **Add `winpty` Before the Docker Command** (if using Git Bash):\\n    ```sh\\n    winpty docker run -it -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 postgres:1\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Add Quotes Around Volume Mapping**:\\n    - `-v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n    - `-v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n    - `-v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n    - `-v \"//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n    - `-v \"c:\\\\some\\\\path\\\\ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\\n\\nIf the command automatically creates a folder called `ny_taxi_postgres_data;C`, this indicates a problem with volume mapping. Try deleting both folders and replacing the `-v` part with other options like `//c/` instead of `/c/`.\\n\\n5. **Change Volume Name Instead of the Path**:\\n    ```sh\\n    -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n    ```\\n\\nThis workaround should help you resolve the \"invalid reference format\" issue you\\'re facing with Docker on Windows. If these solutions do not work, double-check that your repository names and paths are fully lowercase and contain no spaces or special characters.'"

       "\"It appears the issue you're encountering may be due to a port conflict or an incorrect password for your Postgres setup. Here are several steps you can take to resolve it:\\n\\n1. **Change the Port**: The port 5432 might be occupied by another instance. You’re connecting to the port on your machine, not in Docker. Try substituting port 5432 with 5431 (or any other free port you have mapped).\\n\\n2. **Check for Running Services**: If the error persists, check if you have a Postgres service running on your machine. On Windows, you can stop this service to resolve the conflict.\\n\\n3. **Verify Credentials**: Make sure that the username and password you are using are correct. You can verify user access by executing the following commands inside your Docker container:\\n    ```bash\\n    docker exec -it <your_container_name> /bin/bash\\n    psql -U root -d ny_taxi\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Alternative Solutions**:\\n    - Change `POSTGRES_USER=root` to `PGUSER=postgres` in your Docker configuration if applicable.\\n    - Run `docker compose down`, remove the folder containing your Postgres volume, and then run `docker compose up` again.\\n  \\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve your connectivity issue.\""
